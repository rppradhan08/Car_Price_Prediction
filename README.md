This project uses <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=car+data.csv">vehicle dataset</a> from cardekho to predict car price.
Dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com.

### Steps involved
* Reading data from source and performing EDA
* Performing feature engineering to feed desired data into ML model
* Finding best set of hyper-parameters using Randomized Search CV to train the model
* Evaluating various Regressor ML models using cross-validation and residual plot
* Creating web application using flask to predict car price based on various attributes.
* Finally, deploying the web application on cloud based platform (i.e. Heroku) 

### Tools used
Following are the tools/frameworks used in developing the application:
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  
### Libraries
Below is the list of python libraries used in this project:
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import os
import sklearn
import flask
```
## Getting Started

### Installation

To install any of the aforementioned libraries, below command can be written in the Anaconda prompt or terminal :

```
pip install <package_name>
```

### Data Analysis and Model Selection

Refer `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb` to find details regarding data analysis and model selection.

To check model performance, `Residual plot` and scatter plot between `y_test`-`y_pred` are used.

Below are the final metrics obtained for various models that were considered in analysis.

</p>


### Application Development

After model selection, the web application is developed using `flask` which is a python based web-framework. For source code refer `app.py`.

Below are few snapshots of application in use:
* Step 1 Filling attributes related to car

### Model Deployment

Model is deployed on `heroku` which is a cloud based PaaS.
